# Video Clock
##Plays a video, full screen, synchronised to the current time.

Get a video, such as [Standard Time](https://standard-time.com/), and play it full screen.

The video will be synchronised to the current wall-clock time so your video should start and end at midnight.

(Also works with 12-hour videos.)
